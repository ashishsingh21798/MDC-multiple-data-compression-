# MDC-multiple-data-compression-
Encoding data to take up less storage space and less bandwidth for transmission. Digital data are compressed by finding repeatable patterns of binary 0s and 1s. The more patterns can be found, the more the data can be compressed. Text can typically be compressed to approximately 40% of its original size, and graphics files from 20% to 90%. Some files compress very little. It depends entirely on the type of file and compression algorithm used.

Data compression is particularly useful in communications because it enables devices to transmit or store the same amount of data in fewer bits. There are a variety of data compression techniques, but only a few have been standardized.

Encryption is the conversion of data into a form, called a ciphertext, that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized people. Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form, so it can be understood.

languages and Tools used for this project would be:-

Linux Operation System, C programming, gcc compiler, gdb debugger, make, makefile utilities for files management, RCS source code management tool, CVS Server.
